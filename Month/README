Documentation for Files from Oct (‘16)-March(‘17)

October:

Knowledge Space: 

2.py

Find focal deal year from 816_assgn_patent.csv
Map that corresponding deal year to the deal period in the file you've sent me.
Find the number of matches ( if gvkey from 816_assgn_patent.csv == gvkey in Prasad's file)

Product Space:

consistency.py

Checks the intersection in the product space companies and aacquirer space companies

November:

The task is:

1.       Create Network Matrix for Target from 816_taget_gvkeys.csv (Target Matrix)
2.       Find corresponding Acquirer from Master (Acquirer Matrix)
3.       NewMatrix= [Target Matrix] + [Acquirer Matrix]T
4.       Structural Equivalence procedure on NewMatrix
5.       Repeat 1-4 for all targets


Sikuli Scripts:

Concor Pipeline.sikuli: Run CONCOR procedure
Load Targets.sikuli: Load Targets (convert to ##h, ##d from DL files)
Sum Pipeline.sikuli: Load the summed up matrix & 
Load Acquirer.sikuli: Load Acq (convert to ##h, ##d from DL files)

Utility Scripts:

add.py: Sum of NewMatrix= [Target Matrix] + [Acquirer Matrix]T

December:

Work on TNIC Data, returned the master file. 

add4columnstomaster.py: Add Acq Density, Target Density & TNIC scores to Master File. 
addavgs.py:TNIC data is available over a few years. We needed last 3. Add it to master under ‘TNIC 3 years avg’. Note

1. Companies which have no mention in TNIC have been written to as 'No Data'
2. Column 'TNIC 3 year Avg' mentions the past 3 year average and 'TNIC > 3 year Avg' mentions the average of 3+ years. Attempt is to get value for both columns. Which is, even if a company has TNIC scores for past 3 years, I have nonetheless calculated the TNIC average for 3+ years and mentioned it in TNIC > 3 year Avg for use now or in future. If no use, please ignore. 
3. Column Total <= 3 years mentions the number of years that were taken for average for past 3 year scores. Total > 3 years mentions the number of years that were taken for average for 3+ years. 
4. Column 3 Years Considered mentions which three year scores were taken for TNIC 3 year Avg. Similarly, > 3 years Considered mentions which 3+ year scores were taken for TNIC > 3 year Avg.
5. Column R mentions the consistency score. 
6. Columns 'UCI Acq Density' and 'UCI Target Density' mention the respective densities from UCI procedure. 
     
addRtomaster.py: Add R value to Master file
demo.py: Finding how much time it takes to find mapping between TNIC & 	Master file      
makedlv5.py: Make DL file
checkpdpco.py: Testing if we have strong mapping between pdpco (Pdpco is suppose to be unique even after company has gone through M&A) and gvkey. We dont. 

February:

makematrix.py: Find Internal (Self), Forward and Backward Citations in the given files. 


March

Running Sikuli automation on Sandeep’s data. 
Convert.sikuli: Convert DL file to ##h       
Symmetrize.sikuli: Symmetrize the Matrix

On the symmetrized matrix, run 4 procedures:

Closeness.sikuli  
Degree Centrality.sikuli  
Structural Holes.sikuli
Eigenvector.sikuli
