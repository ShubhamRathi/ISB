Objective: Check for Mapping in GVKEY-> ASGNUM

Datasets: 

final_file1_dist_asgnum_allgvkeys_join_NBER_pdpass_name.csv -> Remove(Company Names, Standard Name, PDPASS) -> Created(Modified.csv). Defective entries removed (Company names in place of PDPASS, years etc). Created: Pruned.csv. Remove duplicate rows. 

Algorithm:

for row1 in 816 companies:
	for row2 in Prasad's file:
		if row1(gvkey)==row2(gvkey{1/2/3/4})
			if year match:
				match
			else:
				partial match

Results:

Fully Matched: 147 [18.0147058824%]
Parlially Matched: 503 [61.6421568627%]
Unmatched: 166 [20.3431372549%]

Salient points:
1. 102 rows have Company names in place of PDPASS - Eliminated from calculation
2. 1 AsgNum to multiple PDPASS
